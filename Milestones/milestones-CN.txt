HeatCheck Milestones, Christian Niehaus:

Overview: develop (or find) an image classifier to identify clothing features. 
          How detailed the identification gets will be decided by how hard this ends up being

Rubric:
    15 pts - dedicate required time to project
    10 pts - properly detect metrics about a person's outfit
    10 pts - algorithm to determine 'heat' in fahrenheit
     5 pts - a heat leaderboard

Milestones:
- Image Classifier (ML)
1. Do some learning about convolutional networks in pytorch
2. (Very) Basic classifier to identify pants vs shirts
3. Identify color of clothing articles
4. Speak with Adam on what other metrics would assist in the creation of our heat check algorithm
5. implement as many other metrics as possible before the deadline

- Web Development
1. Help Adam as needed with the web dev side of this project
